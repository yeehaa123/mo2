There is something inherently misleading about the word "revolution." While the term suggests a change of astronomical proportions, those expectations are hardly ever met. That does not mean that revolutions have not happened, do not happen, or will not happen; rather, they come in unexpected shapes, forms, colors, and sizes. The revolution I will discuss in the following pages is tiny. Still, even this assessment of its size is not accurate. For, in this particular case, visual metaphors are inaccurate altogether. Neither a telescope nor a microscope can help observe it. This revolution cannot be seen at all.

Resorting to other sensory metaphors, for instance sonic ones, does not help much either. While we expect a revolution to arrive with a big bang, such loud sounds are hardly ever heard. As a matter of fact, the revolution I address in this essay is so silent that it can hardly be heard. Ironically, this major breakthrough almost gets lost amongst the plethora of sounds and noises that surrounded it. Raising the volume does not help, since that only amplifies background noise. This strange revolution is neither a whisper nor a scream but occurs somewhere in-between sounds. It belongs to a realm that is neither visual nor acoustic.

The event I would like to nominate as a revolution, is James Brown’s introduction of "the One" into popular music. While this term initially designated the first beat of a measure, its meaning in funk music has become irreducible to its original use. This essay tries to unravel what James Brown and his successors – Sly Stone, George Clinton, Betty Davis, Bootsy Collins, Rick James, and Prince, to name but a few – mean when they speak of this enigmatic term. However, the One also exceeds its musical and even musicological relevance. Therefore, this essay removes the term from its original context and inserts it into another: political philosophy. Within this new context, I argue, the One could revitalise the concept of revolution.

The aim of this essay is to transform James Brown's practice of rhythm into a philosophical concept of revolution. The artist's shifts, suspensions and interruptions demonstrate that change does not depend on the extremity or novelty of interventions, but on their critical timing. Before I can conclude that revolutions need to be rhythmic, though, I need to explain why I consider James Brown's practice of rhythm to be revolutionary. This is a challenge, since the One has proven to be an impossible term to grasp. Many musicians, critics, musicologists have tried to define this term, but its meaning constantly slips away. Even James Brown himself gives multiple, often conflicting, accounts of the One. This ambiguity, I argue, is an inherent quality of the One rather than a shortcoming of the definitions. In this essay, I do not offer yet another definition. Instead, I will explain how Brown's revolutionary interventions are embedded in a practice of rhythm. Before I can analyze the One in practice and in detail, however, I (tentatively) need to lay out some of its interrelated characteristics.

The One repeatedly releases rhythm from its secondary and instrumental role in relation to melody and harmony. Through precisely timed and carefully performed interventions, James Brown manages to foreground the groove as soon as it threatens to disappear. Paradoxically, cuts, shifts, and suspensions disrupt the rhythm so that it becomes or remains present. This loss and gain of momentum cannot be explained by the (lack of) complexity of the percussive patterns alone. Rhythm is not only a quality of a song, an artist or even a performance. It also depends on the interaction with other musicians and the listener.

Band and audience, however, cannot be directly controlled by the artist. In order to lure them into his sphere of influence, Brown's rhythmic interventions cunningly double as tests.[^1] The artist's heavy reliance on antiphony (call and response) clearly exemplifies this tactic. Simple phrases such as "Get on the good foot," "Turn me loose," "Hit me," and "Give the drummer some" may appear to be lyrics, but are actually tests-in-disguise. Call and response, though, do not always come in the form of meaningful phrases. Nonsensical shouts, bodily movements or gestures, and percussive sounds often fulfill the exact same function. In fact, these percussive modes of antiphony are the model for verbal ones, not the other way around. Disruptions are tactically employed to probe the quality of a rhythm. They do not have to make sense in order to work. The mere fact of a response is the sole measure of quality. If the band and the listeners react appropriately - whatever that may mean - to Brown's call, then the groove passes the test. If they do not, then the rhythm is apparently not good enough and in need of another intervention. 

Funk is, thus, as much a discursive practice as it is a musical genre. It can only be understood as the interplay between the music, its performers, and their audience. Brown's interventions presuppose a continuous awareness and deep knowledge of this practice of rhythm. James Brown himself, however, is an integral part of this complex web of relations. It is impossible to determine where the performer ends and the practice begins. Although this statement applies to all artists - and subjects for that matter - Brown is a hyperbolic example thereof. Nowadays, his name primarily refers to a recognizable sound rather than a concrete individual. As a matter of fact, much of the music that is endowed with this "James Brown Sound" is neither written, performed, nor produced by the artist. Nonetheless, I believe that this misnomer is actually appropriate. Despite the myths - which are mostly distributed by the artist himself - the godfather of funk was not an autonomous genius. The sound that now bears this name is decisively shaped by many other famous (Bootsy Collins, Bobby Byrd, Fred Wesley), lesser known (Phelps "Catfish" Collins, Marv Whitney), and forgotten musicians and technicians (Bob Both) that worked with Brown, as well as those that either influenced him (Ray Charles, Little Richard) or were influenced by him (Sly Stone, Miles Davis, George Clinton, Prince). Moreover, the "James Brown Sound" would not be the "James Brown Sound" if fans, critics, and causal listeners would not recognize it as such. And why stop there? Apart from other people, non-human elements such as recording studios (Sterling Sound, Twain Recording) record labels (King, Polydor) radio stations (WJBE in Knoxville, WRDW in Augusta) and performing venues (The Apollo) are at least equally important to this recognizable sound. The name "James Brown" therefore does not exclusively belong to an individual artist - let alone a solipsistic monad - but invokes a complex, discursive formation of intra, inter- and extra-musical elements: a practice of rhythm.[^2]  

Within this discursive formation, sudden shifts and unexpected breaks are paradoxically the glue that holds the heterogenous and often conflicting elements together. Even though it is impossible to clearly delineate the borders of Brown's practice of rhythm, it should not be confused for a stable, coherent, all-encompassing unity. Music critic and funk historian Rickey Vincent, for instance, mistakenly conceives the One as a primal, pseudo-religious force that connects everyone and everything. Philosopher Henri Lefebvre attributes similar mystic powers to rhythm in general. In both cases, this abstract unity can only be established by bluntly glossing over concrete differences. Neither Lefebvre nor Vincent actually differentiates between different kinds of rhythm. Musicologist Olly Wilson, on the other hand, carefully specifies the musical tendencies that distinguish African-American music from other genres: downbeat, simple and complex syncopation, improvisation, and antiphony. Although James Brown makes extensive use of all of these tendencies, they will prove to be insufficient to distinguish his particular practice of rhythm within the total field of African-American music. The reason for this, I argue, is that funk's defining characteristic - the One - is not a tendency but an act. It is an operational rather than an ontological term: the One is not, the One does. The revolutionary force of Brown's discursive operations cannot be explained through their musical content alone, no matter how meticulous the analysis may be. 

Brown's rhythmic interventions need to be placed in the discursive formation that they simultaneously hold together, stem from, belong to, and break with. This practice of rhythm is far from a homogenous and harmonious arrangement. On the contrary, funk actually needs the continuous presence of tensions, for instance between the music, its performers, and their audience. Whereas these conflicts are often temporarily and partly suspended, a definite and complete resolution never takes place. More importantly, the eternal continuation of a state of tranquility is not only impossible but would also be undesirable. No tension means no rhythm. The One is thus a discursive operation as well as an ethical imperative: any established status quo must be disturbed. Brown's heavy reliance on (different modes of) syncopation and other forms of arrhythmia underline that the disruption of the groove is as important as its continuation. Shifts, cuts, and suspensions are not external enemies to an otherwise well-tempered practice of rhythm. Rather, these acts of displacement are immanent and necessary conditions that guarantee its vitality.

By repeatedly inserting arrhythmia into its core, James Brown emancipates rhythm from its musical, and even auditory, constraints. The One shows that rhythm does not maintain a privileged relation to sound. Interventions cannot be heard directly. Sounds, noises, and even rhythmic patterns, are merely those effects of underlying operations that present themselves to the listener. Still, a practice of rhythm is not only inaccessible to the ear, but to all the other senses as well. Thus, one can only approach it through its effects. Sensible manifestations are all there is, and yet they are not. Rhythm is always in excess of epistemological positivities. Whereas this may sound mystic, musicologist Anne Danielsen uses Gilles Deleuze's concept of the virtual to explain that it is not (page). Deleuze argues that even the simplest relation is irreducible to its individual components. This does not make relations esoteric or unreal, but simply virtual. Since the rhythm in funk consist of many, heterogenous percussion patterns, and - more importantly - the complex relations between them, Danielsen claims that it constitutes a virtual structure rather than a manifest one. I argue, however, that she thereby misunderstands Deleuze's concept. The virtual is neither a manifest nor a latent structure; it is not a structure at all. Like rhythm, it is not a mode of being but a way of doing: a practice. As a result, Danielsen's analysis only tells one half of the story. It only explains the facts of rhythm, but fails to give an account of its acts. Rhythm is not only virtual, the virtual is also rhythmic. James Brown's interventions exemplify that there is no pre-given, hidden network of relations, but only rhythmic series of precise and specific discursive operations: the virtual is not a structure, the virtual structures. This power to create, organize, transform, and destroy can only be explained by the fact that the virtual is inherently rhythmic. The One reveals that rhythm and the virtual are actually two sides of the same coin. Both concepts signify a practice that repeatedly performs spatializing and temporalizing operations. Even a latent structure is still only an effect of these irreducible acts. Brown's interventions do not exclusively belong to music, sound, images, smells, movements, gestures or anything else for that matter. The One is the virtual and rhythmic interplay between heterogeneous types of sensory data. 

James Brown's shifts, suspensions, and disruptions show that there is no need to conceptualize revolutions as the violent coming of the radical new. His practice of rhythm re-imagines revolutions as irreducible acts of displacement that need to be repeated over and over again. Brown's interventions were neither the first nor the last of their kind, and - after prolonged exposure to funk - may even no longer appear to be very spectacular to contemporary, let alone future, ears. Still, that does not negatively affect the One's critical potential. Its revolutionary power does not lie in newness or extremity, but in unveiling the simple fact that rhythmical interventions can successfully create, structure, sustain, transform, and (eventually) destroy a practice. Simply put, James Brown constantly performs the right discursive operation at the right time and the right place. To him, there is no revolution without a rhythm and vice versa.


## Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag

If the One is a revolution in music, when and where did it take place? If it is not, what are the reasons that it is so often considered to be one? In order to answer these questions, I need to turn to the origin of the One. More precisely, I will analyze the inscribed stories, recording sessions, and live performances of its beginnings. Since it is impossible to reproduce the place, time, and further conditions of this revolution's emergence, inscriptions are all that remain. 

Whenever memory falls short, imagination takes over. The invention of the One has been told - not in the last place by James Brown himself - many times, in slightly different versions. In spite of small variations, the narrative accounts are similar enough to constitute a more-or-less consistent story. In fact, minor inconsistencies actually increase the authority of the story. Disputes about details distract from the underlying consensus. Agreement, however, is not a given but the product of complex discursive operations. Like all origin stories, this shared account of the One's origin simultaneously affirms and obscures its own mythical status. On the one hand, frequent and prolonged repetitions are a necessary condition for an event's recognition and inscription. On the other, the same repetitions make it impossible to separate fact from fiction. Still, the myth of the One needs to be unraveled. Not because its deconstruction will increasingly recover the true circumstances of its invention, but because it will reveal how this particular revolution is discursively constructed, transformed, and sustained.

At first sight, Brown’s major breakthrough seems to be restricted to a minuscule intervention. On “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” (1965), the singer broke with the conventions of the popular music of his time. Instead of emphasizing the second and fourth beat of every measure, Brown accentuated the first and the third. 

> I changed from the upbeat to the downbeat. Simple as that 
> really. (Brown qtd. in Pareles)

Simple as it may have been, it is difficult to precisely determine what James Brown actually did. In spite of the singer’s own words, for one, his revolutionary intervention cannot be reduced to the introduction of the downbeat. Sound recordings contradict the written accounts of the One's origin. They reveal - as I will explain in detail later - that “Papa's Got a Brand New Bag” is far from the downbeat's first, or most exemplary, occurrence in music history. At best, the song marks a break with the conventions of the soul and pop music of its time. Not nearly enough to qualify this song as a revolution, or so it seems. 

Could it be that the problem lies in the term "revolution" itself? Does not the idea of a radical break belong to a now outdated, naive conception of politics and history? Did not the wars and struggles fought in the name of this idea only result in violence and disillusionment? Has "revolution" become so ambiguous and problematic, that it would be better to avoid it altogether? In spite of all these objections, I believe that the concept of "revolution" still has the potential to shape, transform, and consolidate critical practices of politics and history. My reasons for holding on to this word, however, do not lie in its contemporary but in its original meaning. 

The origins of philosophical concepts such as "revolution" are no less mythical than those of "the One". If anything, their authority depends even more on the denial and suppression of their own historicity. As Michel Foucault showed over and over again, philosophy constantly obscures the fact that its concepts are a product of negotiations, exclusions, omissions and other discursive operations. In the case of "revolution," however, there is no need to deconstruct the myth: time already did. Five hundred years of negotiations have changed the concept of "revolution" beyond recognition. As opposed to "the One," the differences between the past and present versions, that I will describe below, do not dissimulate an underlying, shared narrative. They delineate two entirely different concepts of "revolution." This separation into a contemporary and an early account of revolution opens up a space in which the concept's future meaning can be negotiated. 

Etymologically, the concept combines precisely the two contradictory movements that I need to call James Brown's practice of rhythm a revolution. In her book *On Revolution* (1963), Hannah Arendt points out that the term was first used in 16th century astronomy. The original, literal meaning of "revolution" in that discipline is, at least at first sight, the opposite of its metaphorical use in philosophy and politics. It does not refer to the human-ignited process that leads to a radical new order in history, but rather to the eternally recurring cyclical motion of the stars: an unstoppable, natural force outside the reach of human agency. As Arendt states: 
While the elements of novelty, beginning, and violence, all intimately associated with our notion of revolution, are conspicuously absent from the original meaning of the word as well as from its first metaphoric use in political language, there exists another connotation of the astronomic term which I have already mentioned briefly and which has remained very forceful in our own use of the word. I mean the notion of irresistibility, the fact that the revolving motion of the stars follow a preordained path and is removed from all influence of human power. (Arendt 47) 

Arendt distinguishes two aspects of astronomical revolutions: irresistibility and cyclicality. In the contemporary, philosophical or political use of the term, the emphasis lies on the first of these two terms, whereas the second seems to have all but disappeared. Nevertheless, I contend that it is a mistake to assume that the moment of a radical new beginning has completely replaced the cyclical aspect of a revolution. Whereas novelty may appear to be irreconcilable with the idea of a recurring cycle, I will argue to the contrary. In order to demonstrate that phenomenon, however, it is necessary to make a further distinction within the concept of cyclicality itself.  

A cyclical movement is more complex than it seems; thrice as complex to be precise. A cycle is not a single but a twofold motion. Two elements are necessary to define a cyclical movement: it has to consist of both a radical change and a return. To distinguish a cycle from mere movement, both of these aspects need to be present. Neither of them can be more important than the other. The fact of the return does not reduce the change to a mere surface effect, nor does the radical nature of the change relativize the return. 

Whereas in theory both aspects of a revolution are of equal importance, in practice the stress constantly shifts from the one to the other; sometimes the movement of change is accentuated, sometimes the instance of the return. Together, I would argue, this moment and motion are not completed or synthesized into a full cycle, but the periodic oscillation between change and return constitutes a simple – concept of – rhythm. This is where I would like to locate revolutions. They take place neither in a visual nor in an acoustic or any other sensory realm. Revolutions are rhythmical.

Another shift: from the rhythm of revolutions back to a revolution in rhythm. “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is commonly recognized as a landmark in the history of popular music. The mythical status of the song is captured by the following quote from Rickey Vincent’s groundbreaking study *Funk. The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of the One*:[^3]

> The Godfather himself broke down the breakthrough song, the
> 1965 “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag”: "That was the turnaround
> song. It turned everyone around. Because I went on one
> and three as opposed to the music (count) bein’ written on
> two and four. But I also took gospel and jazz and defied all
> the laws." The jerky guitar, absurdly offbeat bass line, and
> sharp burst of brass and guitars had a percussive feel that
> was never heard before. (Vincent 60)

In this quote, there is absolute consensus between Brown and Vincent about the importance of “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” In fact, the critic’s appraisal flows smoothly into the artist’s touting of his own horn, and vice versa. They proclaim in unison that "Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag" was nothing short of a revolution; the song’s minor shift from backbeat to downbeat proved to be more than just a rhythmic slip. 

Vincent equates the surplus value of Brown’s intervention with the One. To him, this enigmatic concept infinitely exceeds the first beat of a measure. The One refers to the spiritual unity of the entire universe. The gospel according to Vincent goes as follows: in the beginning there is the One. The One constitutes a rhythm, then this rhythm connects the different members of a funk band, then this funk band includes the audience in its circle of oneness, and so on, until it finally unites the entire universe. James Brown’s rhythmic slip becomes a cosmic slop.   

Vincent claims that the power of the One to “raise rhythm to a cosmic level” derives from African spiritual performances, in which “everyone’s individual rhythms are essential to the total vibe” (37). To establish the importance of this African legacy for funk, the critic uses the five so-called tendencies of African music that composer and musicologist Olly Wilson defines in his essay “The Heterogenous Sound Ideal in African American Music” (1992). According to Wilson, African music is marked by: 

+ a tendency to rhythmical contrasts;
+ a tendency to sing and play in a percussive manner;
+ a tendency to include call-and-response structures;
+ a tendency to create a high density of musical events;
+ a tendency to incorporate the body in music making (pages).   

Wilson subsequently argues that the same tendencies are also present in African-American music. Vincent uses this argument to root funk in African spirituality. He can only draw this conclusion, however, because he reads the word "tendency" as "feature" or "quality." Tendencies are dynamic: they tend towards something else. In the case of African and African-American music, Wilson argues, there is an inclination towards heterogeneity. To him, the common denominator of those forms of music therefore does not reside in the tendencies themselves but in a shared, normative ideal. Both African and African-American music tend towards what he calls a "heterogeneous sound ideal":

> By this term, I mean that there exists a common approach to 
> music making in which a kaleidoscopic range of dramatically
> contrasting qualities of sound (timbre) is sought after in
> both vocal and instrumental music. The desirable musical
> sound texture is one that contains a combination of diverse
> timbres. (Wilson 1992 //geen jaartal maar titelwoord//: 159) 

Although Wilson searches for the common traits of African and African-American music, he is cautious not to treat them as one monolith. He does not claim that these two categories of music are identical, or even that they exist as such. On the contrary, Wilson does not generalize; he differentiates and pluralizes. The five tendencies function as heuristic tools. Together, they constitute an analytic framework that enables the comparison, differentiation, and classification of different practices of African and African-American music. Whereas these practices all share the same abstract, negative ideal - heterogeneity can only be envisioned as the absence of uniformity - they do not necessarily have any concrete positivities in common. In fact, both practices can both fully subscribe to Wilson's heterogenous sound ideal, and still sound completely different. The five tendencies thus should not be confused for aesthetic qualities. The degree to which they are present or absent: is not in any way a measure of the authenticity, Africaness, purity, originality, or even heterogeneity of a given musical practice.

By using "ideal" and "tendency," Wilson underlines that practices of African and African-American music strive for rather than realize their heterogeneous sound ideal. The unbridgeable difference between this abstract ideal and its concrete manifestations forms the unstable yet common core of all African and African-American music. Tension is the norm rather than exception. Wilson, however, does not understand this inherent impurity and instability as a lack; displacement constitutes the drive behind the practice. Putting an end to this movement in the form of an origin or a telos is neither possible nor desirable. 

Vincent, on the other hand, confuses Wilson’s formulation of the five tendencies with a positive definition of the heterogeneous sound ideal. Moreover, he temporally and spatially locates this ideal in precolonial Africa. The "authentic" roots of funk, and all other forms of African-American music, according to Vincent, reside in the motherland. “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” marks a return to that origin and must therefore be understood as the continuation of an ancient spiritual tradition. In his view, James Brown’s revolutionary shift is actually a religious leap backwards: 

> Many of the world’s religions (particular African ones) 
> emphasize a “cosmic oneness” with everything, rather than
> the Western Christian concepts of man “fearing” God, man
> versus nature, mind versus body, intellect versus intuition.
> The African spiritual root of The Funk is important because
> the essence of funk music, as well as the funk attitude, is
> a return to certain traditional ways, among which are the 
> basics of music-making; a celebration of the earthy, funky,
> emotionally vital way of life; and a cosmology of “oneness”
> in which everything and everyone in the universe is
> interconnected. (258) 

In his interpretation of "The One," Vincent uncritically reproduces all stereotypes of both black music and the daisy age, with one small, yet for our current purposes highly significant, difference: rhythm has replaced harmony in its role as cosmic unifier. From the first beat of a measure to the entire universe, from an African past, via an African-American present, to a global or even cosmic future: Vincent attributes infinite powers to the One. Ironically, the heterogeneous sound ideal that Wilson recognizes as a common thread in African and African American music practices is transformed into an homogenizing cosmology.[^4]

Whereas Vincent uncritically repeats and affirms the mythical account of the One's revolutionary origins, musicologist Anne Danielsen actually debunks the same legend. In her book Presence and Pleasure: The Funk Grooves of James Brown and Parliament, Danielsen argues that many of the features with which “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” has become synonymous – such as downbeat, syncopation, vocal percussion, the One – were retro-actively attributed by musicologists and critics. In an attempt to revise this long history, she goes against the grain by performing a meticulous analysis of James Brown’s songs. While Danielsen acknowledges Brown’s significant contribution to popular music, she points out that his signature sound was gradually introduced throughout the 1960s rather than in a single, landmark song: 

> Certainly, many of the songs from this period – from “Papa’s
> Got a Brand New Bag” in 1965 to the more fleshed-out funk
> tunes of the early 1970s – are more or less funk. They are,
> however, something else as well. It is usually different
> aspects of different songs that point toward the “new
> style”: all of the features listed above – semi-improvised
> vocals, one-chord “harmony,” implied polyrhythm, the
> rhythmic riffing of the horn section and the guitar, the
> fragmentation of the bass line, and an overall percussive
> approach – are relevant, but they are seldom, if ever,
> present at the same time. The transition from rhythm and
> blues to funk, the former represented by tunes like “Papa’s
> Got a Brand New Bag” and “I Got You (I Feel Good)” (1965),
> the latter by “Cold Sweat” (1967), is in many ways rather
> vague, either because the new features to some extend were
> already there or the older ones remained present. 
> (Danielsen 39)

Just like Vincent, Danielsen defines funk with the help of Olly Wilson's five tendencies (31-32). As opposed to the critic, though, the musicologist does not use them to repeat the myth of the One but to unravel it. By confronting the narrative accounts with the actual music, she reveals that “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” does not really contain the tendencies that it is known for. Only a few of them are present in a premature form. Even the much-lauded downbeat, for instance, is mostly missing from the song: ”Moreover, the tune is characterized by a faster tempo than “Cold Sweat” and by an obvious backbeat” (74) 

Danielsen successfully deconstructs the myth of James Brown's spontaneous invention of funk during the recording of “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag." Her close analysis of the music reveals that the origin of the One is in fact plural and dispersed. Its telos, on the other hand, is single and localizable in Danielsen's account. Pure, "fleshed-out," funk does exist, but James Brown's sixties music just is not it, yet. Again, Wilson's heuristic tools are mistakenly understood for aesthetic qualities. In Presence and Pleasure, funk's telos is normatively defined as the full presence of all five tendencies. Danielsen argues that it took a decade before all the pieces finally fell into place. James Brown’s “The Payback” (1971) almost got it right, but the promise of pure funk was first fulfilled in Parliament's "P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)" (1975). 
By making James Brown's rhythmical interventions part of a teleological narrative, Danielsen fails to accept the full consequences of her own deconstruction. Instead of dismantling pure funk as a mythical product of precise and specific discursive operations, the musicologist eventually resorts to a logic of authenticity. Whereas the analysis succesfully avoids the cliches and generalizations that other critics offer, it is normatively motivated by a similar, monotheistic conception of pure funk. The One is still one and not many. The only significant difference with Vincent, is that Danielsen's point of reference lies in the near future rather than a distant past. This telos, in the form of the full presence of all five tendencies, implicitly devalues songs like “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” to lesser, or not-yet, funk. As a result, James Brown’s sixties funk has to settle for being the aesthetically inferior predecessor to George Clinton’s “fleshed-out” seventies flavor: 

> So, even though James Brown and his bands in most ways
> fulfil the style tentatively summed up in The New Rolling
> Stone Encyclopedia of Rock’s attempt at a “definition” of
> funk – “bass-driven, percussive, polyrhythmic black dance
> music, with minimal melody and maximum syncopation” – there
> might be a higher order than the alphabetical at work when
> the next definition to appear is “Funkadelic: See George
> Clinton. (91) 

Whereas Danielsen's depreciation of “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is laid out through a subtler argumentation than Vincent's appraisal, it is based on the exact same evaluative gesture: first, an particular set of aesthetic qualities is declared "pure funk" and then used as a standard to determine the aesthetic value of the song. The actual evaluation took place at the very moment that the norm was set, not when it was applied to "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag." Just as Vincent, Danielsen defines pure funk as the full presence of Wilson's five tendencies. Once these evaluative criteria are set, further assessment is merely a formality. Whether pure funk is realized in African music or P-Funk does not really matter. Such apparent differences only distract from the fact that the critic and the musicologist share a common set of aesthetic values. 

Given this normative bias, Vincent's overly simplistic appraisal of "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" is wrong from the start. Compared to a standard - any standard - everything else falls short by definition. Still, Danielsen's meticulously argued depreciation of Brown's landmark song is equally rigged. Her negative assessment is right no matter what. An analysis of every other piece of music would have produced the same outcome. 

The shortcomings of "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" are not the surprising foundings of Danielsen's analysis, but the product of a (logically, not temporally) preceding evaluative gesture. The musical facts that support her judgement could only be discovered after pure funk's criteria were defined. Such a normative bias is not a mistake as such. On the contrary, it is an epistemological precondition for all forms of content analysis. For positivities to appear, a random set of values needs to be defined as norm. Without such arbitrary decisions, there would be literally nothing to analyze. Problems only arise when these evaluative gestures, and the normative bias that they produce, are not made explicit. In such cases, arbitrary norms are often treated as absolute standards, and epistemological positivities confused for objective facts. Danielsen's analysis of "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" suffers from precisely that mistake. The musicologist - probably unwittingly - obscures the fact that she sets a norm and not merely discovers facts. Her analysis does not reveal any flaws inherent to the song. Instead, all these apparent shortcomings of "Papa's Got A Brand New Bag" are actually produced by her own evaluative gesture.

Except for confusing aesthetic judgements for analytic facts, I argue, Danielsen makes a second mistake that prevents her from properly recognizing the revolutionary interventions Brown's landmark song: a work-based aesthetics. The musicologist tries to locate pure funk in the music itself, and thereby reduces a dynamic, open practice to a static, closed structure.[^5] Olly Wilson manages to avoid this pitfall by strictly separating the abstract norm from concrete music. His "heterogenous sound ideal" can only be defined negatively and thus can never be realized in a landmark song, an exemplary performance, or even an entire oeuvre. As a result, the five tendencies of African and African-American music are constantly engaged in multiple, open-ended practices. Danielsen, on then other hand, conflates the norm and its concrete manifestations. Her ideal - pure, "fleshed-out" funk - actually exists in the music of Parliament/Funkadelic, and is clearly defined by a specific set of recognizable, musical charateristics. As a matter of fact, only because their end is presumably, already fulfilled can funk's tendencies be mistaken for aesthetic qualities. Removed from their unreachable goal, they are no longer in a constant state of excess. By substituting an abstract ideal for a concrete norm, Danielsen tames an excessive and vital practice of rhythm and turns it into a well-defined but lifeless genre of music. Her normative, work-based approach to aesthetics rids Brown's shifts, interruptions, and suspensions of their most important quality: the fact that they are interventions, acts, or, in my preferred term, operations.

Vincent and Danielsen both fail to recognize the revolutionary aspect of “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” Their focus on the origin/telos of funk prevents them from truly acknowledging his rhythmical innovations. It does not make sense to declare the One "groundbreaking" when it is considered either a mere repetition of African music or an immature version of P-Funk. But, even though the critic and the musicologist retroactively forge Brown's interventions into a continuous, linear narrative, they still need them to be interruptions. In their respective narrative accounts, these necessary displacements are manifested in the One's itinerary. Depending on whose version you follow, funk traveled either all across time and space from precolonial Africa to postcolonial America (Vincent) or, in a much less adventurous, versionfrom Charlotte, North Carolina in the 1960s to Detroit, Michigan in the 1970s (Danielsen). These spatial and temporal shifts, are not accidental detours. They are discursive operations that authorize, negotiate, rewrite, repeat, consolidate, and continue the myth of the One. Along with rhythmic interventions, Brown's revolutionary practice is also constituted by narrative detours such as these. The same principle that applied to revolutions and music, is equally valid for stories: interruptions keep them going. Ironically, accounts that aspire to break with the commonly accepted version of a narrative - Danielsen's deconstruction of the One's mythical origins, for instance - often are most apt to sustain and continue it. Revolutions, music, and stories, none of them can do without irreducible acts of displacement: their rhythm needs to be syncopated. 


## Talkin’ Loud & Sayin’ Nothing 

Since it seems to be impossible to explain Brown's revolutionary interventions through an analysis of the music alone, it may help to shift to a philosophical perspective on rhythm. Without explicitly mentioning the term, the French philosopher Henri Lefebvre uses the idea of syncopation, i.e. the displacements of beats or accents, to revitalize the concept of rhythm. In Elements of Rhythmanalysis: An Introduction to the Understanding of Rhythm (1992), he rejects the mechanical connotations that the concept has acquired in common parlance. Lefebvre insists that rhythm is more than the periodical repetition of notes, movements, or objects: 

> We easily confuse rhythm with movement, speed, a sequence of
> movements or objects (machines, for example). Following this
> we tend to attribute to rhythms a mechanical overtone, 
> brushing aside the organic aspect of rhythmed movements.
> Musicians, who deal directly with rhythms, because they
> produce them, often reduce them to the counting of beats: 
> "One-two-three-one-two-three." Historians and economists
> speak of rhythms: of the rapidity or slowness of periods, of
> eras, of cycles; they tend only to see the effects of
> impersonal laws, without coherent relations with actors,
> ideas, realities. Those who teach gymnastics see in rhythms
> only successions of movements setting in motion certain
> muscles, certain physiological energies, etc. (5-6) 

Syncopation is the implicit point of departure for Lefebvre’s so-called "rhythmanalysis": a science dedicated to rhythm and its entanglement with everyday life. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he considers the repetition of regular patterns as meter rather than rhythm. The word "meter" has to be taken literally here. It enables the quantification and subsequent commodification of space and time. Meter coincides with a repeating movement that divides and sequentializes, like metronomes, mechanical clocks, or machines in a factory. As a result of this repetition, space and/or time are transformed into a series of equal units. Since artificially regular intervals can only be produced by mechanical devices, Lefebvre identifies meter with technology. (page). 

Lefebvre dismisses meter as the disciplining, commodifying, and homogenizing principle of modern capitalism. Rhythm, on the other hand, is its organic antidote. To him, its typical manifestation is not music - since it is still connected to instruments - but the human body, which Lefebvre conceives as a bundle of rhythms. Each organ has its own rhythm, while it can only exist in relation to those of the other organs, establishing a bodily polyrhythmia. Eurhythmia is the term that Lefebvre introduces for a healthy bundle of rhythms. Arrhythmia is a state of crisis in which the synchronization between the organs fails to occur (page). There is either harmony or crisis, but nothing in between. According to Lefebvre, rhythm can never be single; it is always a multiplicity (page).
Apart from the observation that the human body offers the best example of rhythm, Lefebvre also connects rhythm to the organic through the concept of cyclicality. He argues that the cycles of nature counter and compensate for the rigid, disciplining meter of work, politics, and technology. Nature versus culture: Lefebvre reformulates an all-too-familiar conflict and does not make much of an effort to hide his own preference: 

> The study of everyday life has already demonstrated this 
> banal and yet little-known difference between the cyclical
> and the linear, between rhythmed times and the times of
> brutal repetitions. The repetition is tiring, exhausting and
> tedious, while the return of a cycle has the appearance of
> an event and an advent. Its beginning, which after all is
> only a recommencement, always has the freshness of a
> discovery and an invention. (Lefebvre and Régulier 73) 

While the constant repetitions of linearity is exhausting, the periodic return of cyclicality is revitalizing. Despite the normative language that Lefebvre uses to describe these two concepts, he nevertheless maintains that they should not be understood as binary opposites. Linearity and cyclicality are inextricably linked: they are two perspectives on one and the same process. While the moment of return produces the effect of cyclicality, the periodic repetition of the same moment produces a series. Linearity and cyclicality are not opposites, but come together in a third concept: rhythm. Rhythmanalysis dissolves this age old dichotomy, and, according to Lefebvre, all other binary oppositions as well. 

Coming from a Hegelian/Marxist background, it is no surprise that Lefebvre incorporates rhythm into a dialectic schema. In this schema, rhythm is always positioned in-between opposites, such as melody and harmony, difference and repetition, internal and external measure, space and time. Although Lefebvre does not mention change and return explicitly, the two aspect of a cyclical movement easily fit in this series of oppositions. In all cases, rhythm is seen as a third and equal element that forms a triadic constellation with the other two:

> Triadic analysis distinguishes itself from dual analysis
> just as much as from banal analysis. It does not lead to a
> synthesis in accordance with the Hegelian schema. Thus the
> triad "time-space-energy" links three terms that it leaves
> distinct, without fusing them in a synthesis (Lefebvre 12) 

Lefebvre criticizes Hegel's emphasis of synthesis over thesis and antithesis, and tries to overthrow the hierarchy between the three terms.[^6] As a modification of dialectics, his rhythmanalysis, is not dual but triadic.   

In rhythmanalysis, the first two terms of the triad are variables. Every binary opposition can take their place. The third term, however, is a constant: rhythm. Despite its multiple manifestations – secret rhythms, public rhythms, fictional rhythms, dominating-dominated rhythms, to mention a few – this constant is primarily defined negatively. Rhythm is determined in relation to the other two terms. This triad schema of dialectics not only equalizes, it homogenizes as well. For, all the different forms of rhythm eventually have to fit in this straightjacket. They are restricted by their mediating function, and therefore they do not appear all that different from each other. In every manifestation thinkable, this “concrete universal” (45) has to oscillate periodically, but not necessarily regularly, between two polar opposites. In Lefebvre’s modification of Hegel’s dialectics, rhythm replaces matter - which is actually spirit - as the dividing and connecting force behind the appearances.[^7] Lefebvre writes: 

> Everywhere where there is interaction between a place, a
> time and an expenditure of energy, there is rhythm. (15) 

To Lefebvre, rhythm is more than a musical or aesthetic phenomenon; it is a universal organizing principle. Given that totalizing scheme, however, it is easy to see that rhythmanalysis ends up erasing its point of departure of syncopation. Whereas Lefebvre starts from the irreducibility of rhythm to a regular pattern, he ends up suggesting that rhythm is the only constant in the triad. Rhythmanalysis cannot deal with syncopation. The structure fully annihilates the (possibility of an) event. Rhythm ends up as meter. 

Rhythmanalysis proves incapable of solving the question that ignited it: What makes rhythm different from meter? The solution that Lefebvre proposes, is... rhythm. But of course that amounts to begging the question. To be fair, the vicious circle does not bother Lefebvre. In his view, cyclicality and rhythm are inextricably linked anyway. Moreover, rhythmanalysis seems more concerned with the problems of time, space, and everyday life than with rhythm itself. In Lefebvre's philosophy, rhythm is more a concept that explains, and less a principle that needs to be explained. 

Nonetheless, Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis falls short of constituting a science that explains rhythm. I contend that it suffers from the following two flaws:

1. Lefebvre makes rhythm into a universal principle. Rhythm loses all its specificity and cannot be further explained. Rhythmanalysis can analyze everything but rhythm itself.

2. Lefebvre accepts continuity as the desirable state of rhythm. Consequently, all elements that presuppose an element of discontinuity, novelty, innovation, disruption, displacement, are treated as unwanted dangers. But precisely those elements distinguish rhythm from meter. By avoiding interruptions, rhythmanalysis transforms rhythm into meter. 

Lefebvre turns rhythm into a universal “perpetuum mobile.” Syncopation would be the logical solution to break this vicious circle. However, this is an answer that the philosopher cannot accept. For, in that case, he would need to introduce at least one extra term into his triads. Syncopation or dialectics: confronted with this dilemma, the philosopher unfortunately opts for the latter. As a result, rhythmanalysis can only define an abstract and general concept of rhythm. Making it plural and specific would mean the end of his triadic schema. Fully aware of this problem, Lefebvre tries to go around it as follows: 

Is the origin of the procedure that starts with generalities found in abstractions? No! In the field of rhythm, certain very broad concepts nonetheless have specificity: let us immediately cite repetition. No rhythm without repetition in time and in space, without reprises, without returns, in short without measure. But there is no identical absolute repetition, indefinitely. Whence the relation between repetition and difference. When it concerns the everyday, rites, ceremonies, fêtes, rules, and laws, there is always something new and unforeseen that introduces itself into the repetitive: difference. (6)

While this explanation may seem plausible at first, it reproduces the same problem with different concepts. If absolute repetition does not exist and every cycle introduces something new, would not every occurrence of meter inevitably also be a rhythm?

Lefebvre uses rhythm to gain access to the particularities of space, time, and everyday life, but he ends up losing the particularities of rhythm. Rhythm becomes everything, and everything becomes rhythm. Ironically, the science that is dedicated to rhythm cannot distinguish meter from rhythm, and a rhythm from rhythm. In the end, there is not much of a difference between Henri Lefebvre's rhythmanalysis and Rickey Vincent's account of the One. Both the philosopher and the music critic transform rhythm into a cosmic unifier, and thus deprive it from the element that endows it with its critical potential: syncopation or, more precisely, an irreducible of displacement. 


## Get Up for the Down Stroke 
In order to further clarify the significance of syncopation for rhythm, I must shift from Lefebvre’s abstract rhythmanalysis back to James Brown’s concrete rhythm production. Next to downbeat and the One, syncopation is a third innovation for which “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is often credited. The song is known to mark the beginning of more and more complex offbeat- and polyrhythms in James Brown’s songs and in popular music in general. 

In an earlier essay, “The significance of the relation between Afro-American Music and West African Music” (1974), Olly Wilson argues that West-African polyrhythms are complex forms of syncopation. Following Don Knowlton (1926), Aaron Copland (1927), and Winthrop Sargeant (1938), Wilson distinguishes primary rag (or simple syncopation) and secondary rag (or complex syncopation). Whereas both of these modes emerge from an act of displacement, they differ in range and complexity. Primary rag is a momentary interruption of a particular rhythmic pattern, for instance by incidentally stressing the one and three instead of the two and four. Secondary rag, on the other hand, emerges from the contrast between many rhythmic patterns. These patterns, however, can only be recognized as different because they are displaced in relation to each other. Wilson therefore concludes that complex syncopation is in fact a synonym for polyrhythmia: 

> The application of newer analytical procedures to this 
> question suggests that the distinction between 
> syncopation and polyrhythm is a function of the rhythmic 
> hierarchic level upon which the displacement occurs. Hence,
> if the foreground rhythm (i.e., basic metrical pulse) is not
> displaced or is displaced only momentarily, the result will
> be syncopation (…) but if the foreground rhythm is displaced
> (…) or a lesser rhythmic level is displaced over a long time 
> span, the effect of polyrhythm will occur. **(Wilson 1974 //
> titelwoord ipv jaartal//:  9)**

The distinction between simple and complex syncopation helps to clarify Brown’s interventions. Through an analysis of “Super Bad” (1970), Wilson shows that what is commonly referred to as downbeat, is actually an example of polyrhythm. Rather than emphasizing the one and three on all instruments, the stress is only shifted in the case of some of them. The rest of the band remains on the two and four, or vice versa. Thus, Brown’s downbeat has to be understood as a relative gesture rather than a fixed structure. 

Wilson’s account of the origin of downbeat confirms the general concept of revolution that I have developed in the beginning of this essay. Brown’s innovation did not so much entail a radical, structural transformation, but rather started with a barely perceptible shift. The musicologist’s concept of complex syncopation explains why those looking for big changes in “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” will end up being disappointed.[^8] The loud bangs and flashes of lightning simply do not occur. Only a microscopic analysis is capable of revealing the minuscule but major displacements that take place in the song. 

Anne Danielsen does exactly that. She moves back five years in time to locate Wilson’s complex syncopation in its commonly accepted origin, “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” As to be expected, Danielsen once again concludes that the fabled revolution takes place in stories and anecdotes rather than in the song itself. She shows that “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is neither a heavily syncopated nor a polyrhythmic song. However, the musicologist cannot fully banish the legendary narrative to the realm of fiction. A tiny and ambiguous example of syncopation manages to resist her scrutiny: 

> The only element that pulls in the direction of a pulse
> level above eights is the “undersized” phrasing in horns 
> and guitar mentioned above: the downbeat in anticipation 
> (Danielsen 75) 

On “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” the “short toot” of the horns on the fourth beat are much shorter than expected, whereas the guitar’s “snappy phrasing” on the second beat is equally odd. The understated horns and guitar make way for a heavy beat on the one; in other words, they seem to anticipate a downbeat. That expectation, however, is not met. Closure is suspended. On “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” the stress never lies on the first beat of the measure. Danielsen therefore refers to the effect as downbeat in anticipation.[^9]

The downbeat in anticipation should not be confused with a "normal" downbeat. If anything, the rhythmic pattern of “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is a distorted backbeat, but that qualification does not do justice to its full complexity, either. Rhythmically, the song is marked by ambiguity. On the one hand, the short phrasing of the horns and guitar emphasize the absence of a downbeat. On the other hand, this act of negation works to bring the one and three to the fore.   

The phrase “downbeat in anticipation” refers to this ambiguous gesture rather than to the particular pattern that produces it. This aesthetic strategy is not limited to “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” or, for that matter, to the music of James Brown. Downbeat in anticipation should be understood a complex discursive operation, a play with expectation that is irreducible to downbeat, backbeat, or any other rhythmic pattern. As Danielsen concludes: 

> Put simply, the rhythm as a whole points to one location of 
> the main basic pulse, while a certain part of the groove, 
> the downbeat in anticipation, denies it. The groove as a 
> whole refers the pulse to the beats, while the downbeat in 
> anticipation hides them: what is anticipated never arrives; 
> there is no orderly, unambiguous downbeat. The accurate beat 
> is thereby suspended, because one has already passed the 
> beat that was expected to come. The downbeat in anticipation 
> is, in other words, not equal to a real downbeat that is 
> played too early. The anticipation is played too late to 
> form a syncopation – as such it never completes its own 
> movement. The closing, which is as significant for its 
> shaping as the beginning, never occurs: the anticipation
> never ends on an alternative strong beat. It only 
> overshadows the beat that is supposed to be there – or, 
> alternatively, it stretches the beat out in time. (85) 

Strictly speaking, “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is not syncopated because the horns and guitar do not break with the main rhythmic pattern. The backbeat is only temporarily displaced. The trick that James Brown repeatedly pulls off in this and later songs is fairly simple. The horns and guitar are played twice as fast as the rest of the instruments. Whereas the latter play half notes, the former play quarters. To put this differently, the song as a whole sounds slower than it is actually played. In effect, some of the notes that sound odd to the listener are not really syncopated (in the sense of the case of primary rag). This perceived syncopation is the result of the difference in tempo between the instruments rather than of any active displacement within the rhythmical pattern. In other words, in downbeat in anticipation the simple syncopation that the listener experiences is in fact an effect of polyrhythmic syncopation. Consequently, not each instance of secondary rag is an example of primary rag, and not every polyrhythm relies on downbeat in anticipation. These are in effect three different rhythmical operations that nonetheless share a most important quality: they all rely on an act of displacement.

Danielsen discovers that “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” only contains one instance of “false” syncopation. But the fact that this intervention is not capable of breaking the pattern does not make it flawed.[^10] On the contrary, I believe that the aim of James Brown’s interruptions is exactly the prolongation and heightening of such moments of suspense. In the decade following “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” the artist refined this strategy to perfection. At his peak, Brown’s rhythmical skills were comparable to those of a cowboy that punches out the profile of his target without actually hitting it. On songs like “Cold Sweat,” “The Payback,” and “Super Bad,” downbeat in anticipation is no longer a deviation from a rhythmical pattern, it has become the song’s very foundation. Danielsen continues: 

> Viewed this way, the downbeat in anticipation is something
> more than a local phenomenon tied to particular positions in
> the fabric of rhythm. It is rather a way of phrasing that
> eventually comes to characterize figures of rhythm in
> general and then spreads to whole layers of rhythm.
> (Danielsen 75) 
Danielsen correctly shows that “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” just hints at this strategy and, in a sense, only anticipates the downbeat in anticipation. Still, it is a mistake to dismiss this particular song as the immature precursor to Brown’s later work. Though the song’s intervention is minuscule, it is nonetheless a significant step towards more complex forms of syncopation.   

The downbeat in anticipation is simultaneously a precursor, a combination, and a distortion of Wilson’s two modes of syncopation. None of these three acts of displacement, however, is causally connected to the downbeat itself. Therefore, we should not assume an immediate connection between syncopation and downbeat, let alone conflate them. Nothing whatsoever makes a downbeat inherently syncopated. A beat that constantly stresses the one and three sounds equally mechanic as one that stays on the two and four. Syncopation is irreducible to the downbeat or to any other rhythmic pattern; instead, it coincides with an act of displacement. This shift can only be defined as a (temporary) break within a particular structure, even if – as is the case with complex syncopation and the downbeat in anticipation – the displacement is, or becomes, part of another pattern.   

Wilson and Danielsen’s analyses of Brown’s interventions provide a different angle to the question that Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis could not solve: What distinguishes rhythm from meter? While the musicologists agree with the philosopher that rhythm is relational and therefore a multiplicity, their concept of polyrhythm is different from Lefebvre’s. Polyrhythmia is not the result of harmony and synchronicity between different elements. On the contrary, the close analysis of Brown’s music reveals that it is the effect of multiple and specific acts of displacement. Arrhythmia, not eurhythmia, constitutes polyrhythmia. Lefebvre argues: 
> In arrhythmia, rhythms break apart, alter and bypass
> synchronization (the usual term for designating this
> phenomenon). A pathological situation agreed! – depending on
> the case; interventions are made, or should be made, through
> rhythms, without brutality. (page) 
Whereas this description of arrhythmia is accurate, I disagree strongly with Lefebvre's diagnosis and treatment. It is actually eurhythmia without arrhythmia that leads to a pathological state. Wilson verbalizes an insight that Brown put into practice throughout his career – and for this very reason, he really was the hardest working man in show business – unexpected and occasionally brutal, interventions are necessary to either keep a rhythm going or to start a new one. Arrhythmia is not antirhythmia; it is neither the enemy of rhythm, nor an accidental state of exception. Syncopation, as well as other kinds of interruptions, are a necessary condition for the emergence, transformation, and continuation of rhythm. Again, it is an act of displacement that distinguishes meter from rhythm. Rhythm can only be constituted through interventions. Arrhythmia is not rhythm’s antidote, it is its antipode. You cannot walk on one foot, let alone dance. 


## Feet Don’t Fail Me Now 

“Get On the Good Foot.” This deceivingly simple phrase that Brown often shouts when he actually makes a shift – and, of course, the title of one of his biggest hits – captures the difference between rhythm and meter perfectly. For one, these five words mark the unpredictability of the interruption. It is impossible to know in advance, which of your two feet is the good one. It all depends on the moment in which the phrase is heard. As opposed to meter, rhythm is time-critical. 

Moreover, “Get On the Good Foot” implies that the subject of rhythm is dynamic rather than static. In fact, even the nature of his or her activity itself is already presumed in the phrase. Brown expects, better yet, demands that his audience is dancing, just like the performer himself. In most other pedal activities – walking, biking, running, or marching — there is no good foot, only another. Both feet are equal and the shift from the left to the right one is irrelevant. In dancing, however, the choice between the left and the right foot is highly significant, even though it cannot be determined in advance. 

The combination of rhythm and dance is very obvious. Nonetheless, it is necessary to repeat this cliche because Brown’s practice of rhythm has changed not just music but also dance beyond recognition. His interventions changed the latter to such an extent that it is almost impossible to recall how it was understood before. Like rhythm, dancing is now in tension with meter, regularity and predictability. It is at odds with predefined moves, steps, gestures, and patterns.

In *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* (1880), Friedrich Nietzsche seems to anticipate this transformation, but displaces it to the distant past rather than the near future. Zarathustra, his proto-philosopher, introduces the distinction between dancing and meter as follows:

> Ask my foot if it likes their melodies of praise and
> enticement! Truly, to such a measure and tick-tock beat it
> likes neither to dance nor to stand still. 
> (Nietzsche 188-189) 

A simpler or better definition of rhythm probably does not exist: rhythm is something that you have to dance to. The kind of dancing to which both Zarathustra and Brown refer is neither ballet nor ballroom. Their dance has no choreography. The dancer is, literally, slave to the rhythm. Feet follow beat, not the other way around. The beat, however, is not self-sufficient either. The groove is not a “perpetuum mobile.”  Rhythm cannot exist without unexpected interruptions. The dancer, in turn, can therefore never fully get comfortable. The apparent regularity of the rhythmic patterns is most deceiving. 

Apart from the importance of timing and unpredictable breaks, “Get on the Good Foot” emphasizes that a third element is necessary to constitute a rhythm: displacement. While you might not know whether it is the left or the right foot, you can count on the fact that it will be the other. The good foot will always be the one that you are not currently standing on. The moment of the change - not the choice of feet  - is inherently unpredictable. Shifts between the left and the right foot, the up- and downbeat, change and return, and every other opposition can and will become "old bag" pretty fast. 

In “Of the Refrain” (1980), Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari criticize, almost ridicule, Henri Lefrebvre’s rhythmanalysis and its triadic schema:

> It is well known that rhythm is not meter or cadence, even
> irregular meter or cadence: there is nothing less rhythmic
> than a military march. The tom-tom is not 1–2, the waltz is
> not 1,2,3, music is not binary or ternary, but rather
> forty-seven basic meter as in Turkish music. 
> (Deleuze/Guattari 313) 

Though Deleuze and Guattari agree with Lefebvre that two elements are not enough to distinguish rhythm from meter. The argue that neither is three, nor in fact forty-seven. According to them, rhythm is always in excess. Regular and even irregular oscillation between a fixed set of elements cannot constitute a rhythm, let alone a revolutionary one. At least one extra element is always needed: an irreducible act of displacement. 
Rhythm is revolutionary because it is excessive. This may sound nice in theory, but how does it work in practice? It leads to the same questions that I started this essay with. What does excess sound like? What kind of noise do revolutions make? The answer to those questions is now simple: none. Still, revolutions do occur in music. In fact, look no further than “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag.” It is not the downbeat that makes the music of James Brown sound syncopated. Even the downbeat in anticipation became a cheap trick after a while. No revolution can ever be explained from a pattern, no matter how complex that pattern might be. There is no rhythm without an unexpected shift. Deleuze and Guattari continue: 

> We always come back to this "moment": the becoming-
> expressive of rhythm, the emergence of expressive proper
> qualities, the formation of matters of expression that
> develop into motifs and counterpoints. We therefore need a
> notion, even an apparently negative one, that can grasp this
> fictional or raw moment.” (Deleuze/Guattari 322) 

Brown’s the One, I argue, signifies the same "moment" that Deleuze and Guattari describe in this quote: the becoming-expressive of rhythm. As Vincent already argued, this enigmatic term cannot be reduced to the first beat of a measure, even though this might be its point of departure. His answer - that the One is a cosmic unifier - however, is not the only imaginable surplus value. In spite of its name, the One is actually a twofold operation. Brown’s shifts (1) produce and reveal a heterogeneity of rhythmic patterns and then (2) combine those different strands into a polyrhythm. In other words, the One pluralizes before it unifies.   

Even more important than the production of a plane of heterogeneity, is the insight that not all rhythmic interventions are the same. Different shifts construct different soundscapes. The plurality of these cuts, however, cannot be exclusively explained from the pattern itself. From the perspective of the pattern, they always seem to be the same. Hence, the moment of displacement can only be defined negatively: as a break, cut, shift, difference. Wilson’s and Danielsen’s close analysis of James Brown’s interventions, however, has revealed that those creative acts come in many shapes and forms. Rather than solidifying one particular operation into the essence of James Brown’s music, I argue that it is exactly the ongoing chain of displacements that marks the revolutionary aspect of his practice of rhythm. Downbeat, syncopation, and even downbeat in anticipation are not goals in themselves but are all different tactics that serve the same purpose: to liberate rhythm. 

Through repetitive and strategic interruptions, Brown released rhythm from its secondary and instrumental role to melody and harmony. The fact, however, that rhythm occurs in-between – between notes, instruments, patterns – does not mean that it does not exist. Danielsen borrows a term from Gilles Deleuze to describe the virtual status of rhythm: 

> Even though the structures of reference at play in a rhythm
> are not actual sound, they should not be regarded as
> something abstract or external to the music. Rhythm happens,
> so to speak, in the midst of actual sound and non-sounding
> virtual structures of reference (which, moreover, might have
> to do with the perceptual processes generated in the
> listener), and the sounding event may play both with and
> against the virtual structure. (Danielsen 47) 

Indeed, the fact that rhythm occurs in-between does not make it unreal but virtual. Nonetheless, Danielsen overlooks the fact that rhythm is not only virtual, but also the other way around. In other words, Deleuze’s "virtual" does not primarily consist of structures and relations but of acts of displacement. The so-called “virtual structures of reference,” I argue, are merely an effect of these unexpected interruptions, or as Danielsen calls them, “sounding events.”  Rhythmic interventions, however, do only not occur in music and sound. Every spatio-temporal process can be suspended. Brown’s shifts thus not only emancipate rhythm from melody and harmony, but also release it from its confinement to the aural. In his autobiography, the artist recalls the recording sessions of “Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag”:
 
> I had discovered that my strength was not in the horns, it
> was in the rhythm. I was hearing everything, even the
> guitars, like they were drums. I had found out how to make
> it happen. On playbacks, when I saw the speakers jumping,
> vibrating a certain way, I knew that was it: deliverance. I
> could tell from looking at the speakers that the rhythm was
> right. (Brown and Tucker, 159) 

It is striking that Brown recalls his discovery as a visual experience. Obviously, he does not imply that rhythm belongs to sight rather than sound. Rather, Brown points out that rhythm involves a plurality of senses. Rhythm is neither sonic, visual, olfactory, nor haptic. It takes place in-between the senses, in a practice of its own. Nonetheless, Brown needed an accidental shift to discover the One. His words suggest that this change from sight to sound was unintentional. The artist never planned the intervention that became synonymous with his name. It was not James Brown that performed an irreducible act of displacement; instead, the One produced him. He is literally a subject of rhythm, or, as Deleuze and Guattari call it in "On the Refrain," a rhythmical persona.


## Rhythmic Slip 

“Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag” is not a revolution because it caused cosmic alterations. It simply acted out a minuscule shift. A change that cannot be seen, touched, smelled, or heard but that is real nonetheless. Ironically, I believe that music history made a tiny slip of its own while determining James Brown’s place. In their attempt to make sense of the artist’s words, critics and musicologists commonly assume that the stress lies as follows: 

> "I changed from the **upbeat** to the **downbeat**. 
> Simple as that really." 

Obviously, the emphasis disappears in the transition from speech to writing, and the artist’s true intentions will remain unknown. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that the meaning of the quote changes completely if the stress is slightly changed:
 
> "I **changed** from the upbeat to the downbeat. 
> **Simple** as that really." 

Perhaps, Brown did not want to emphasize the downbeat but the change and its simplicity. In that case, one may argue that the following statement would have sufficed:
 
> "I **changed**. Simple as that really." 

Still, that would not be quite the same, since the specificity of the shift is lost in the process of the reduction. There is a fine line between simplification and oversimplification. Brown tried to stay on the right side of that border. As I have tried to show in this article, no shift is alike, and there is nothing more complex than simple change. The One is a complex, discursive operation that is marked by an inherent ambiguity, managing to emancipate rhythm by disrupting it. Paradoxically, arrhythmia not only disrupts a beat, it starts and/or sustains it as well. This ambiguity is easy to recognize in Brown's music. The elements that guarantee the continuation of the groove are precisely those that interrupt it. 

James Brown's simple change is in fact an ongoing series of cuts, shifts, and suspensions. Each of these operations is aimed at the reduction of rhythm to its core. The One reveals that, stripped down to its bare minimum, rhythm turns out to be arrhythmic. Brown's repeated, revolutionary interventions transforms static rhythmic patterns into an excessive practice of rhythm. Nonetheless, the One provides some sort of a foundation. Paradoxically, the ongoing acts of displacement continuously ground Brown's unstable practice of rhythm. To perform such constitutive, rhythmic operations, however, knowledge of music is not enough. The One is irreducible to a determinable positive content: its interventions coincide with their meaning.  

Even though the terms “essence” and “common core Africanness” may suggest the opposite, Wilson makes the same argument in the following quote: 

> Therefore, the particular forms of black music which evolved
> in America are specific realizations of this shared
> conceptual framework which reflect the peculiarities of the
> American black experience. As such, the essence of their
> Africanness is not a static body of something which can be
> depleted but rather a conceptual approach, the
> manifestations of which are infinite. The common core of
> this Africanness consists of the way of doing something, not
> simply something that is done. (Wilson 1974 //geen jaartal maar titelwoord//: 20) 

Brown’s innovations are his interventions, and it is in this sense that the artist fits in the tradition of African music. Colonialism made sure that this history cannot be marked by continuity. African music, however, compensates for the impossibility of an uninterrupted story. Its history consists of the cuts that it performs. Paradoxically, Brown (and many others) only belong to this lineage by breaking with it— until, that is, his innovations were re-appropriated by tradition. The fact that it is difficult to hear his revolution now, is not a flaw of the music. It is an inevitability. The groove can only be disrupted for a moment. Revolutions are not permanent breaks, but are suspended interruptions in a cyclical motion. 

On a conceptual level, the same problem repeats itself in different forms. In order to define a revolution, cyclicality, rhythm, or syncopation, an act of displacement is indispensable. On a analytical level, a similar series of displacements occurs: downbeat, the One, syncopation, downbeat in anticipation. None of those notions as such is able to explain why “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” was a revolution. Nonetheless, the recurring answer would not be: an act of displacement. It is a mistake to believe that I stumbled upon the exact same intervention over and over. On the contrary, to be irreducible every act must be unique. In other words, analysis should not be satisfied with repeating the same answer. It has to show how each of these precise and specific operations is constituted. Therefore, I propose to distort the temporality at stake. A revolution has no past and future; it produces a past and future. Rather than ending with the irreducibility of the act, it is necessary to start from the intervention itself. “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” is an excellent example of such a minor but major shift: a rhythmic slip.

[^2]: In this essay, "James Brown" is therefore not used as a proper name but as a conceptual persona. Whereas the former refers to individuals, the latter coincide with assemblages of heterogeneous, interconnected elements. As opposed to the person, the persona James Brown does not just signify an artist, but also includes (aspects of) his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors ....Brown that I develop in this essay mostly overlaps with the aforementioned practice of rhythm. Still, it is crucial to underline that these two constellations are similar but not completely identical. The One tactically and creatively exploits the minimal differences and frictions between the persona and the practice. Precisely, the fact that they are almost-but-not-quite the same allows for mutual interventions.

He ignores, however, that Parliament’s antipode, Funkadelic, should be understood as the necessary counterpart to this mysticism. Where Parliament’s lyrics and imagery are commonly marked by a transversal movement to Outer Space and beyond, Funkadelic’s songs often move back in the exact opposite direction: Mother Earth. In my opinion, these two movements are of equal importance. 
Compare, for instance, the lyrics to Funkadelic’s “Better By The Pound” from the album Let’s Take It to the Stage (1975):

The truth is rather that the insubstantial nature of logical forms originates solely in the way in which they are considered and dealt with. When they are taken as fixed determinations and consequently in their separation from each other and not as held together in an organic unity, then they are dead forms and the spirit which is their living, concrete unity does not dwell in them. As thus taken, they lack a substantial content — a matter which would be substantial in itself. The content which is missing in the logical forms is nothing else than a solid foundation and a concretion of these abstract determinations; and such a substantial being for them is usually sought outside them. But logical reason itself is the substantial or real being which holds together within itself every abstract determination and is their substantial, absolutely concrete unity. One need not therefore look far for what is commonly called a matter; if logic is supposed to lack a substantial content, then the fault does not lie with its subject matter but solely with the way in which this subject matter is grasped.” (Hegel 48) 

[^8]: The feeling of disappointment is probably also heightened by the fact that musical notation often does not do justice to the rhythmical complexity of James Brown’s songs. Wilson claims, for instance, that on “Super Bad” the drums and horns imply an alternating 3+3+2 meter. The stress lies on the first beat of each chord, in other words: a downbeat. Notated in a 4/4 schema, however, their patterns look like an upbeat. 

> Although the wind instruments (along with the snare drum)

[^9]: Danielsen derives the term “downbeat in anticipation” from a comment that James Brown made in the introductory liner notes to his greatest hits compilation Star Time (1991). Here, the artist redefines his contribution to music history as follows. “Then I thought about the people around me. I wanted to come up with something that would give us a place in the business. That’s when I hit on “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag”. It was a slang that would relate to the man in the street, plus it had its own sound: the music on one-and-three, the downbeat in anticipation.” (3) Danielsen convincingly argues that this quote does not just refer to the premature status of the effect. Even though they are highly relevant, discussing the political implications that Brown attributes to his discursive operation exceeds the scope of this article.

# Towards a New Intellectual   

## A Shared Dilemma

>> I'm not what I seem.   
>> But that's okay.   
>> Artists thrive on contradictions.   

>> Marvin Gaye

Occasionally, the results of mistakes are much more interesting than those of hard work. Marvin Gaye’s hallmark album *What’s Going On* (1971) serves as one of those miraculous examples of serendipity. During the mixing sessions of the title song and first single in 1970, a rather fortunate accident occurred. When the artist asked his sound engineer Ken Sands to play two alternate takes of the main vocals, the technician unwittingly played both tracks simultaneously. The unintended result was a duet between the singer and himself. Gaye liked this side-effect to such an extent that he not only decided to keep it, but even pushed this mistake to the extremes. Not content with mere duplication, the artist multiplied his voice several times on the final mix of the album. The harmonic, multilayered vocals became this record’s most recognizable feature.

By the time of the recording of his next solo album, *Let’s Get it On* (1973), Gaye had mastered this technique of overdubbing to perfection. In fact, he used it so frequently that his ‘old-school’ producer, Ed Townsend, even openly wondered if the singer was still capable of singing an entire song in one take. Nonetheless, it was precisely this extensive use of multitrack recording that turned his multilayered vocals into more than just a stylistic novelty. On this album, the singer capitalized on the immanent possibilities of the technical medium to play out the doubts, discussions and arguments that he had with himself. As a result, *Let’s Get it On* released the dissonant voices from the isolated existence in Marvin Gaye’s head and harmonized them on the multiple tracks of the recording.

Nevertheless, the album was more than just a therapeutic exercise of a troubled artist. In my opinion, the accidental duplication and intentional multiplication of Gaye’s voice are not harmless but have enormous philosophical, psychological and practical ramifications. Multitrack recording irreversibly cut the person Marvin Gaye up into a wide range of alter egos. The contradicting voices that were captured on *Let’s Get it On* can impossibly be reunited into a single, coherent one. They are autonomous personae rather than different aspects of a schizophrenic personality. 

Multitrack technology accidently rendered the unified subject obsolete. The resulting effect of polyphony, however, has often been accused of being of mere esthetic interest. According to this line of criticism, the multiple voices of Marvin Gaye’s records and other works of art are purely fictitious, not part of any concrete discursive practices and can therefore impossibly initiate any social and cultural transformations. In this presentation, I will argue that it is exactly the other way around. Personae rather than individuals are the genuine subjects of discourse. Any person is part of multiple, diverse practices and is therefore incapable of fully identifying with the role that any particular one of them forces on him. Correspondingly, I suggest a re-conceptualization of the post-human subject as an arena in which the confrontation between different roles takes place. The new intellectual proposed here, is an example of such a battle field.

## The Dilemma of the Black Intellectual

In his essay ‘The Dilemma of the Black Intellectual’ (1985) Cornel West vocalizes the unique predicament of the title’s protagonist: 

> “Caught between an insolent American society and insouciant black community, the Afro-American who takes seriously the life of the mind inhabits an isolated and insulated world.” 

Although it is quite easy to misinterpret this quote as such, West actually refuses to define the subject of his dilemma in essentialist terms. The importance of the black intellectual neither consists in his skin complexion nor his ethnic lineage but in the ongoing tension between the contradictory roles that are imposed on him. Cornel West situates this specific individual in the struggle between the American society and the black community.

Instead of repeating the exact details of West’s analysis of the black intellectual’s predicament, I will here focus on the text’s implicit but crucial, theoretical contribution to discourse analysis. ‘The Dilemma of the Black Intellectual’ subtly shows that a subject first emerges when an individual finds himself caught between at least two practices. As long as an analysis is limited to a single discourse, one can only speak of a subject position or a persona. Subjects, on the other hand, emerge in the confrontations between multiple practices; they are borderline figures by definition.

It is precisely such a clash of discourses that gives rise to West’s so-called dilemma of the black intellectual. The singularity of this situated individual consists in the fact that the white society and the black community both try to impose a particular role on him. In the specific case of West’s protagonist, the former practice pushes the intellectual to adapt to its *“bourgeois model of academic legitimation and placement”*, whereas the latter only seems to value his ‘life of the mind’ when it comes in the form of a performance or a sermon. Although West claims that the black community does not have an intellectual tradition in the academic sense, he nevertheless recognizes 

> “…two organic intellectual traditions in African-American life: the black Christian tradition of preaching and the black musical tradition of performance.” 

West, however, neglects to further distuingish between these two intellectual traditions and treats them as identical. In my opinion, he thereby misses a chance to fully capitalize on the opportunities that his method offers, because he does not take the situatedness of his protagonist seriously enough.

West’s juxtaposition of two practices implies that in order to be acknowledged by both practices the aspiring intellectual has to play the role of The Scholar and The Performer at the same time. Both the white academy as well as the black community try to impose a specific set of norms, rules and expectations on the black intellectual. In other words, these discursive practices force him to act out contradictory roles. It is of crucial importance to notice that the black intellectual can never fully identify with neither The Scholar nor The Performer. What constitutes the protagonist of Cornell West’s dilemma is the struggle between two discursive practices rather than a fixed identity. Instead of lamenting the loss of a coherent subject, however, he values the transformative possibilities that this split personality offers.

## Biography  

In his obituary for the legendary soul singer, West describes Marvin Gaye as an excellent example of his black intellectual. Nonetheless, his appreciation of the artist’s intellectual and social achievements is limited to *What’s Going On*. West describes the importance of the album as follows: 

> “This groundbreaking album was not only the first conceived and enacted by the artist (as opposed to studio staffers), but also the first concept album that hung together by means of a set of themes – themes concerned with socio-economic critique and Christian outlook.” 

To him, the relevance of *What’s Going On* consisted in the fact that Marvin Gaye exploited his gift as a performer to communicate his Christian message of love, peace and harmony. Because his status as a superstar gave him credibility to both a mainstream and a R&B audience, the artist was capable of influencing both the American society as well as the black community with his sermon.

Unfortunately, Cornel West neglects to incorporate some crucial biographical facts about Marvin Gaye in his analysis of *What’s Going On*. These omitted details add up to a more complex portrait of the artist/intellectual. They reveal the tension between the glamorous life of the performer and the moral ways of the priest. West ignores, for instance, that the singer was already heavily drug addicted during the recording of What’s Going On. Nor does he mention that Marvin and his first wife Anna Gordy had extramarital affairs on a regular basis. Above all, however, West completely ignores Gaye’s continuous fight with his father who was a preacher in the House of God church. All these fact inevitably suggest that Christianity, and the expectations and values that it preaches, were a problem as much as a solution to the singer. 

Whereas these personal struggles only appeared in the background on *What’s Going On*, they are foregrounded on *Let’s Get it On*. The latter album documents Gaye’s difficulties to combine spirituality and sexuality. Although the message of the album is as explicit as that of *What’s Going On*, the singer now not just preaches his sermon but also allows us to see his personal doubts, sins and temptations. This shift is literally reflected in the strange recording history of the album’s title song. At first – and I will play a clip of this now – the song tries to recreate the formula of *What’s Going On*. As you can hear, this song initially had a purely political meaning. *“Understanding and brotherhood”* Marvin sings *“Everybody ought to try and do some good”*. Gaye once again tried to convince the world of the need for love, peace and harmony. After meeting his future second wife – seventeen year old Janis Hunter – during the recording session, however, the song instantaneously acquired an extra layer (another clip). Superficially, explicit sexuality now appears to be the message of ‘Let’s Get it On’ and it is for this exact reason that Cornel West refuses to acknowledge its intellectual value. Closer inspection, however, reveals that it is actually the tension between the spirituality, and sensuality that is the main motive of Gaye’s later works.

What this example shows is the fact that for real, situated individuals such as Marvin Gaye – rather than the abstraction that The Black Intellectual actually is – the Christian and the performative African-American tradition are not as homogenous as West seems to suggest. They are two separate discursive practices, each with their own norms and standards. For this reason, it does not suffice to situate the subject between two conflicting personae. It is necessary to multiply and complicate these roles even further. Multitrack recording gave Marvin Gaye the opportunity to literally do this. On *Let’s Get it On* the conflicting voices that stem from discursive tensions become apparent and even sound harmonized. The technology proved to be capable of bringing together oppositions that the subject Marvin Gaye failed to reconcile.

As argued above, the value of Cornel West’s essay consists in the fact that he does not situate the intellectual as part of any particular discourse but in the struggle between two discursive practices. However, *Let’s Get It On* teaches us that his oversimplified juxtaposition of American society and black community simply reinscribes the traditional dichotomy between mind and body – or knowledge and experience – on a discursive level. As a result, everything that is not academic is homogenized under the title performance. Situating the black intellectual between more, and more specific practices, could create a way out of thinking in terms of such dualities. 

## Conclusion  

Whereas Cornel West describes his dualist model for future intellectuals, Marvin Gaye performs his pluralist alternative. The artist was the arena for multiple, not just two, conflicting discursive practices. Nonetheless, as his albums prove, human beings are not the exclusive site of these confrontations. Every other medial expression can fulfill the same function and sometimes they are up to the task even better. In fact, I would claim that is actually the technical medium that allows us to view the human subject differently. 

One could even argue, that Marvin Gaye’s records accomplishes things that he could no longer achieve as a person. The success of records like *What’s Going On* and *Let’s Get it On* actually consists in the fact that they reconcile different personae and could thereby function as a non-utopian horizon for personal and social change. In fact, these albums harmonized the dissonant voices and their corresponding discursive practices that the singer would continue to struggle with the rest of his life. I would argue – and this is also my starting point for further discussion – this eventually leads up to the conclusion that a human subject has no prioritized status over other medial expressions. Each record, each movie, each book and each picture can be conceived as a space where different personae are confronted with one another and can therefore function as actors of social transformation.
